# Tool: Project Scope Statement 
## Project Name
Final Project : Chicken Coop Project 
## Project Purpose
This project is to communicate information to others of just some of what I have learned in the design and development of a chicken coop/run. It should just be a simple reference to just a few consepts that I have learned and I do not expect a reader to be able to build an actual coop buy viewing this webpage.
## Description
I would like to cover the following items:
1.  The difference between free ranged and not free ranged/enclosed chicken keeping. 
2.  The size of a run. One chicken to ten square feet. 
3.  The purpose of deep litter system verses just a at oor with shavings. 
4.  How to chose the number of rails. their length and size. 1 chicken 1 foot instead of one chicken 8 inches. 
5.  The need for good ventilation over a stuy environment of the coop 
6.  One image of layout. 
7.  Listing references of where I got the ideas from. 
## Desired 
The page should be easy to read. It should cover the items breifly listed in my description. It is more important that it showcases what I have learned about Project Management, html, css, and GitHub than the actual information I give. 
## Exclusions 
While I would like it look nice it does not have to be perfect or professional as that is not required for the project.I  won't cover everything I've learned about coop build due to time constraints. Like the nesting boxes. I won't cover ramps vrs ladders. I won't cover doors and gates, I won't cover watering systems or feeding systems. This is not to show how to litterally build a coop, but demonstraight just some of what I have learned and researched.
