### Tool: Project Scope Statement 
## Project Name
Final Project : Chicken Coop Project 
Project Purpose To communicate the information to others in the design and development of a chicken coop/run I am building as a hobby for pet chickens that are not free ranged.
## Description
I would like to cover the following items:
1.  The difference between free ranged and not free ranged/enclosed chicken keeping. 
2.  The size of a run. One chicken to ten square feet. 
3.  The purpose of deep litter system verses just a at oor with shavings. 
4.  How to chose the number of rails. their length and size. 1 chicken 1 foot instead of one chicken 8 inches. 
5.  The need for good ventilation over a stuy environment of the coop 
6.  One image of layout. 
7.  Listing references of where I got the ideas from. 
## Desired 
The page should be easy to read, descriptive, and look decent if pulled up on a cell phone or a computer. 
## Exclusions 
While I would like it look nice it does not have to be perfect or professional as that is not required for the project.
